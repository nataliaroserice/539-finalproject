    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      This website is inspired by a poster I designed for a graphic design course. I developed an A-Z list of 26 low(ish) maintenance plants, illustrated each by hand, researched their care needs, and placed them all into a modular grid. Since then, I've considered how I could continue building on it: Stickers? Prints? 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Then, when deciding on a final project for my Web Design course, I realized the plant poster could make for a joyful and potentially useful online resource. So, I decided to turn it into an interactive guide for people who love the idea of plants but need forgiving options. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Whether you're figuring out what kind of light your apartment gets or just want something that won't react dramatically in the face of infrequent watering, I hope this helps you find a plant that aligns with your lifestyle and commitment level.
